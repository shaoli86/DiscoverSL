Description: A computational pipeline to predict synthetic lethality in cancers from
    multi-omic cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Features derived from
	mutation, copy number alteration and gene expression data are combined to develop
	a multi-parametric Random Forest classifier for prediction of synthetic lethal
	interaction in cancers.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)

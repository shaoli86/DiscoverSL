# DiscoverSL
A computational pipeline to predict synthetic lethality in cancers from multi-omic cancer data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Features derived from mutation, copy number alteration and gene expression data are combined to develop a multi-parametric Random Forest classifier for prediction of synthetic lethal interaction in cancers.
